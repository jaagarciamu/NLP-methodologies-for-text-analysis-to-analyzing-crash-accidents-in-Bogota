Road accidents are a major cause of death in emerging economies and the leading cause of death among young adults up to 28 years old. In Bogota, over 500 deaths are registered annually due to road accidents, and the district is working to improve understanding of this issue. Technical and technological means are used in road control and safety programs to understand the importance of statistical analysis of road accidents and the application of advanced techniques. Data from the Police Traffic Accident Report (IPAT) and data science techniques and natural language processing are used to analyze road safety issues in the city. However, the hypothesis of accidents is often not correctly recorded in the IPATS Report by road agents, leaving it in observations stored in databases without analysis. The study aims to analyze traffic accident records using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify key elements and patterns, aiding in district policy decisions.


**Key words**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning Algorithms, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
